# JavaTextCaptchaBreaker
TextCaptchaBreaker program implemented in Java programming language.

This project is inspired from https://github.com/kbhomes/TextCaptchaBreaker.

Unlike the original one which tries to find the correct answer in its first try, this version focuses on finding all possible answers to determine the overall solvability of the test. 

Statistics for 1000 random textCAPTCHA tests are given below.
